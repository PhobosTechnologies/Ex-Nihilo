# Ex-Nihilo

This is as simple as not.

Basic idea sprang from asking several questions at once.

Q1: Why has it been so difficult to figure out why there doesn't appear to be the same amount of matter and anti-matter in our universe?

Q2: How am I going to get the transmitters (for a different project) to interact in a symmetrically asymmetric manner? (it's ok if you have no idea what I'm talking about - this is just one of the questions that sorta gave birth to working this out in code)

Q3: If you took three mobius strips and interlinked them in a symmetrically stable manner (each with a sine wave drawn on them such that the wave propagates correctly as it crosses the twist in the strip, with the outer sides overlapping in a way that the waves on the outer edges of the construct cancel each other out); what would this thing look like functionally? What would the waves look like on the inside? Invent the Star Trek-style "triaxialating frequency" (on a covariant subspace band :P)?

That's about it. If you want to use this (probably useless for most applications), go for it.
